### 문제 설명

<p>The wise Sir Bedavere often uses non-standard logic, yet achieves positive results. Well, it seems he has been at it again, this time with division. He has determined that canceling the common digit of a numerator and denominator produces the correct answer. Of course, Sir Bedavere only tried this on a small sample of three digit numbers. An example of what he did is shown in the following division problem (in which he canceled the common 6):</p>

<p>\( \frac {166}{664} = \frac {16}{64} \)<br>
If you divide this fraction, 6 of 16”6” and 6 of “6”64 are cancel out.</p>

<p>Your task is to find all three digit number combinations with the following property:</p>

<p>number combinations where removing the rightmost digit from the top number (numerator) and the identical leftmost digit from the bottom number (denominator) leaves the result of the calculation unchanged.</p>

<p>Omit all of the trivial cases — xxx/xxx = xx/xx (222/222 = 22/22). The solutions are to be shown in increasing order of the top number (the numerator).</p>
