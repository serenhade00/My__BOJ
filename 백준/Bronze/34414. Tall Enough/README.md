### 문제 설명

<p>The new amusement park you've opened has a small problem: people are riding your roller coasters without meeting the safety requirements! Instead of hiring more employees to enforce the safety requirements, you decide to augment your coaster control system with a new safety check.</p>

<p>The system you're creating will accept a list of heights in inches and will output "True" if all of the heights are greater than or equal to $48$ inches. If any of the heights are less than $48$ inches, it will output "False".</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line is $n$, an integer between $1$ and $1\,000$ inclusive, defining the number of heights you'll receive.</p>

<p>The next $n$ lines will each contain a single height in inches. Each height will be an integer between $1$ and $1\,000$ inclusive.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If any of the heights are less than $48$ then output "False" without the quotes. Otherwise, output "True" without the quotes.</p>
